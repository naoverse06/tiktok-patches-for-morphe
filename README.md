# TikTok Patches for Morphe

<br>

**This repository is a Morphe patch source for TikTok.**

**It continues the work from earlier community TikTok patch sets, including ReVanced, with the patches adapted for Morphe and tested against newer TikTok builds. The current target version is [TikTok `43.8.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok/tiktok-43-8-3-2-release/tiktok-43-8-3-4-android-apk-download/), with metadata support for both `com.zhiliaoapp.musically` and `com.ss.android.ugc.trill`.**

The goal is to keep the existing patch set usable while adding more TikTok-focused features over time. Some features are small fixes, some are quality-of-life changes, and some need deeper testing because TikTok changes its internals often.

<br>

## Available Patches

- `Settings`: Adds the Morphe settings screen inside TikTok.
- `Enable Open Debug`: Uses TikTok's hidden Open Debug settings cell as the entry point for Morphe settings.
- `Disable login requirement`: Lets supported TikTok flows load without the normal login wall first.
- `Fix Google login`: Restores Google sign-in behavior after patching.
- `Feed filter`: Filters feed items such as ads, livestreams, stories, shop content, image videos, and videos outside configured view or like ranges.
- `Downloads`: Downloads videos without watermark and adds download-related controls.
- `Playback speed`: Adds playback speed controls.
- `Remember clear display`: Keeps the clear-display state across videos.
- `SIM spoof`: Spoofs SIM-related values used by TikTok region logic.
- `Sanitize sharing links`: Cleans TikTok share links before they leave the app.
- `Show seekbar`: Shows the video seekbar where TikTok would normally hide it.

## Supported Target

- App: TikTok
- Version: [`43.8.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok/tiktok-43-8-3-2-release/tiktok-43-8-3-4-android-apk-download/)
- Build code: `430803`
- Global package: `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`
- JP package: `com.ss.android.ugc.trill`

The local APK used while adapting and testing this source was `com.ss.android.ugc.trill` `43.8.3`. The patch metadata also declares `com.zhiliaoapp.musically` `43.8.3` because that is the common global TikTok package.

## Building

Build the Morphe patch bundle and metadata:

```bash
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList
```

The generated bundle is written to:

```text
patches/build/libs/patches-0.1.0.mpp
```

Morphe reads `patches-bundle.json` from this repository, downloads the `.mpp` release asset listed there, and loads the patch metadata from that bundle.

<br>

## Project Structure

- `patches/`: Kotlin patch definitions, fingerprints, and shared patch utilities.
- `extensions/`: Java extension code injected into TikTok by the patches.
- `patches-list.json`: Generated patch metadata.
- `patches-bundle.json`: Morphe source metadata for the published release bundle.

## Notes

- The source is based on [RookieEnough/De-Vanced](https://github.com/RookieEnough/De-Vanced) and the [Morphe patches template](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches-template).
- It is not affiliated with TikTok, ByteDance, or Morphe.
- TikTok changes often, so compatibility is intentionally tied to the exact version and packages listed above.
